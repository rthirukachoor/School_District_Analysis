# School District Analysis
## Overview & Purpose of Project:

This project is about School district analysis where the insights about the school performances have been derived to analyze further. The results
have been derived primarily in 2 different slices i.e. District wise and School wise analysis.

Purpose of this project is to analyze how the school performances have been and if any trend can be derived so that it can be improvised further in future.


## School District Analysis Results:
###  High Performing schools

    - Cabrera High School is ranked #1 as best performing school with the over all passing of 91%~
    - Thomas High school is ranked #2 with the over all passing of 90%~ among best performing schools even though their 9th grade scores (both Math and Reading) have not been considered.
    - Compared to the School Data analysis result of this course where the top performing schools are same though in 
    challenge school analysis task 9th grade scores of 'Thomas High School' have not been considered.
    - All top 5 performing schools are Charter School types where student population is moderately low.

### Low Performing Schools

    - 'Rodriguez High School' is the least performing school with the over all passing of 52%~.
    - All least 5 performing schools are District school types where Student population is moderately high.
    - When we compare challenge School analysis result with course School analysis result as far as least performing schools are
     concerned they are pretty much same schools.

### Math Scores by Grades per school

    - As far as Average Math score is concerned, not a big variations of score among different grades for a school
    is there except 'Thomas High School' where Math grades have not been considered.
    - In comparision to the 'Math Scores by Grades' result done in the course, the challenge has similar result
    except for 'Thomas High school' for the obvious reason.

### Reading Scores by Grades per school

    - As far as Average reading score is concerned, not a big variations of score among different grades for a school
    is not there except 'Thomas High School' where reading grades have not been considered.
    - In comparision to the 'Reading Scores by Grades' result done in the course, the challenge has similar result
    except for 'Thomas High school' for the obvious reason.

### Scores by school Spending
    
    - As spending ranges per student increase, the '% Oveall Passing' decreases. 
    - Compared to the results of the course, the challenge has same result.

### Scores by school size

    - Schools having more than 2000 students, the '% Overall Passing' decreases significantly.
    - Compared to the results of the course, the challenge task outcome for this is same.

### Scores by school district type

    - Charter schools have better '% Overall Passing' compared to district schools.
    - Especially '% Passing Math' for district schools is very low(67%~) compared to Charter school which is quite high (97%~).
    - Compared to the results of the course, the challenge task outcome for this one is same.

## School District Analysis Summary:
     
     - Highly populated schools (Schools having more than 2000 students) are low performing.
     - Charter schools are better performing than district schools.
     - Schools where spending/student is low perform better than schools where spending/student is high.

## Future steps to improve the school performance:

     - Looks like in District schools, more focus on Maths need to be there as the '% Passing Math' for District schools
     is way lower compared to Charter schools.
     - More funding for highly populated district schools(schools having more than 2000 students) to improvise their performance.
